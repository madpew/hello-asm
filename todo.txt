open tasks:
- implement sound fx
- implement menu / cursor functionality
- implement music

later:
- look into meta-tiles, meta-maps etc.
- look into 4bit packing (like I used in the GBDK version of PSS)
- optimize functions calls by using RST Vectors: eg. put "jp hl" at offset $8 and  use "rst $8" instead of "call _hl"



Rework Game.asm to use jump tables + call, so Load can RET, which should solve the call load in tick problem.

FuncTableLoad:
dw	LoadIntro
dw	LoadFight
dw	LoadWinner
dw	LoadLoser
dw	LoadHelp

FuncTableTick:
dw	TickIntro
dw	TickFight
dw	TickWinner
dw	TickLoser
dw	TickHelp


    _hl:
        jp hl
=====
    ld bc, [wCurrentScene]
    ld hl, JumpTable
    add hl, bc

    call _hl
