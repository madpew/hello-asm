test background-map animations (loop through map and change tiles)
    if too slow, only update visible part of the background

test window or background-map switch _SCRN0, _SCRN1

implement vsync overlap check (check if vsync happens while still in vsync code)
look into meta-tiles, meta-maps etc.
look into 4bit packing (like I used in the GBDK version of PSS)
