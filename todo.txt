open tasks:
- implement sound fx
- implement menu / cursor functionality
- implement music

later:
- look into meta-tiles, meta-maps etc.
- look into 4bit packing (like I used in the GBDK version of PSS)
- optimize functions calls by using RST Vectors: e.g. put "jp hl" at offset $8 and  use "rst $8" instead of "call _hl"
