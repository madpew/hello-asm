Ideas for optimizations:

CAUTION: Do not optimize if not required to keep the code clean (easier to read and understand + reuse)

Intro-Screen:
    Updating the whole shadow-map in vblank is very inefficient for the used effect.
    Only a single line of tiles is changed, so this could be either done in hblank or optimized to only update that row.

Winner/Loser-Screen:
    Both are rather static screens (right now) and could share the same Tick-procedure.
    Custom animations will require splitting them again, but with some clever planning this could be avoided as well.

ShadowMap:
    Since the whole game doesn't scroll, the shadow-map could be sped up by only copying the 20x18 area instead of the whole map.

General:
    Optimize calls by using RST Vectors: e.g. put "jp hl" at offset $8 and  use "rst $8" instead of "call _hl"
