Intro-Screen:
    Updating the whole shadow-map in vblank is very inefficient for the used effect.
    Only a single line of tiles is changed, so this could be either done in hblank or optimized to only update that row.

Winner/Loser-Screen:
    Both are rather static screens (right now) and could share the same Tick-procedure.
    Custom animations will require splitting them again, but with some clever planning this could be avoided as well.

Fight-Screen:
    The HUD could be part of the background instead, to not require messing with the window at all.

General:
    Since the whole game doesn't scroll (should the fight scene be scrollable?), the shadow-map could be sped up by only copying the 20x18 area instead of the whole map.
