Ideas for optimizations:

CAUTION: Do not optimize if not required to keep the code clean (easier to read and understand + reuse)

ShadowMap:
    Since the whole game doesn't scroll, the shadow-map could be sped up by only copying the 20x18 area instead of the whole map.

General:
    Optimize calls by using RST Vectors: e.g. put "jp hl" at offset $8 and  use "rst $8" instead of "call _hl"

CP A, X
c: A < X
nc: A > X

LESS EQUS "c"
GREATER EQUS "nc"

# Topics for future research

- look into meta-tiles, meta-maps and meta sprites
- look into 4bit packing for maps (like I used in the GBDK version of PSS)

# Unexpected Rendering Problem:
Sprite Priority doesn't work how I anticipated. Thus some parts of the code should probably be done differently.
(Especially the whole "wall tile below cats" thing).
Sprites are sorted by: Y Coordinate > X Coordinate > OAM-Index
Priority is just "over write BG" or "only overwrite white background" instead of OAM-Priority.
