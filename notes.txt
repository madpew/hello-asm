Ideas for optimizations:

CAUTION: Do not optimize if not required to keep the code clean (easier to read and understand + reuse)

ShadowMap:
    Since the whole game doesn't scroll, the shadow-map could be sped up by only copying the 20x18 area instead of the whole map.

General:
    Optimize calls by using RST Vectors: e.g. put "jp hl" at offset $8 and  use "rst $8" instead of "call _hl"
