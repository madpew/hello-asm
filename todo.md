# Todo
- animate flowers
- make better sounds (layer the channels to get richer effects)
- move hud into window

## Optional Features (Wishlist)
### Phase 1 (likely)
- add music (custom music format or go with a proven solution)
- add a proper screen transition instead of using the shadow-map refresh as an transition

## Future Ideas:
- add difficulty selection and balance times/enemycount/throw probability accordingly
- add obstacles and powerups
- add x-movement to balls (curve balls)
- add animations to win/loose/menu screen
- rewrite and fix the ai state machine. waiting in between states messes up code relying on current state (e.g.: score relies on state being "down" to see if a enemy got hit while in the moving or throwing phase and is thus kinda random atm.)

## Finish: (1-2 days)

- put the game on a cartridge and test
- fix bugs found on the real hardware
- finalize and print cartridge label and gamebox
- Make photos and finish the article
- upload to homebrewhub, itch.io
